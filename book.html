    The author of the book is Trevor Noah. He was born during apartheid in South Africa.<br>
     Apartheid is a term given to the policy that regulated South Africa’s relations with its<br>
      white minority and non-white majority during the 20th century. This dictated the South Africans,<br>
       based on their race, where they could live and work. In my county, the apartheid rule exists where my <br>
       people are discriminated against according to their social status and tribes. <br>
Trevor’s mother, Patricia was a devoted Christian. They would attend three different churches and each church had a different race. <br>
In my county, Christianity is practiced. The majority of the people in my county are Christians. <br>
The birth of Trevor was against the law and it was so dangerous for his parents to be seen together in the city. <br>
Crime is evident from this because interracial sex was not allowed. Trevor was a product of interracial sex. In my county,<br>
 Crime is evident, some people don’t follow the laws put in place. For example, they still sneak into the forests to cut the trees <br>
 which is against the government laws.<br>
Family is evident from the book. Trevor was brought up during the apartheid time. His mother brought <br>
him well, and she did not deny him the right of seeing his father despite him being from another race and<br>
 it was gainst the law.In my county, the aspect of family is portrayed and parents take good care of their children.
