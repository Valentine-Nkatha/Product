    <p>The author of the book is Trevor Noah. He was born during apartheid in South Africa.<br>
     Apartheid is a term given to the policy that regulated South Africa’s relations with its<br>
      white minority and non-white majority during the 20th century. This dictated the South<br>
      Africans,based on their race, where they could live and work. In my county, the apartheid 
      <br>rule exists where people are discriminated against according to their social status and tribes. <br>
      <br>
Trevor’s mother, Patricia was a devoted Christian. They would attend three different <br>
churches and each church had a different race.In my county, Christianity is practiced. <br>
The majority of the people in my county are Christians. <br>
<br>
The birth of Trevor was against the law and it was so dangerous for his parents to be seen <br>
together in the city.Crime is evident from this because interracial sex was not allowed. <br>
Trevor was a product of interracial sex.In my county Crime is evident, some people don’t <br>
follow the laws put in place. For example, they still sneak into the forests to cut the trees <br>
 which is against the government laws.<br>
 <br>
Family is evident from the book. Trevor was brought up during the apartheid time. His mother<br>
 brought him well, and she did not deny him the right of seeing his father despite him being <br>
 from another race and it was gainst the law.In my county, the aspect of family is portrayed and<br>
  parents take good care of their children.</p>
